            You see, your homepage needs to wear a lot of hats.
            Rather than treating it like a dedicated landing page built around one particular action, 
            it should be designed to serve different audiences, from different origins. 
            And in order to do so effectively, it needs to be built with purpose.
            In other words, you'll need to incorporate elements that attract traffic, 
            educate visitors, and invite conversions. 
            One way to ensure your homepage is as effective as possible is by using HubSpot's drag-and-drop website builder, 
            which allows for the creation of a dynamic, purpose-driven homepage that caters to various audience needs
